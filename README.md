# üõ°Ô∏è Honeypot Security Automation Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project implements a basic **honeypot** using Python on a **Windows Server 2019** environment. Its purpose is to simulate a vulnerable system to attract, log, and analyze unauthorized access attempts. A secondary **Windows 11 laptop** is used to simulate attacks for testing purposes.

This project supports cybersecurity learning objectives by providing hands-on experience with network security monitoring, automation scripting, and intrusion detection fundamentals.

## üéØ Objectives

- Build and deploy a Python-based honeypot on Windows Server 2019.
- Simulate threat actor behavior using a Windows 11 client machine.
- Log incoming connection attempts and record them for future analysis.
- Implement optional enhancements like port filtering and geolocation tracking.
- Use AI tools to assist in design, coding, and debugging.
